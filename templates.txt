treat %s as a %s
a %s as a metaphor for %s
it was as if the %s was a %s
%s but with the properties of a %s
like a %s in a %s
if a %s and a %s were combined with a %s
%s without a %s
%ss but moreso
a %s pretending to be a %s
%s but for %ss
%ss with %ss
%ss for %ss
inside the %s was a %s
several %ss
a %s is thinking about %ss
an important %s
%s of the %ss
a %s reminiscent of %s
you can't have %s without %s
beware the %s of %ss
something is wrong with this %s
a few good %ss
%ss... in %s
4 out of 5 %ss recommend %s
it was only a %s
a new %s
my %s can beat your %s
at first it was a %s, but then it was a %s
